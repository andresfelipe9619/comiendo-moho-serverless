# @react-native-firebase/ml
This package is mostly discontinued since these APIs are no longer available in the latest Firebase SDKs. To call the Cloud Vision API from your app the recommended approach is using Firebase Authentication and Functions, which gives you a managed, serverless gateway to Google Cloud Vision APIs. For an example Functions project see the vision-annotate-images sample project.
